# Forge

Forge is a local-first AI software-development orchestrator. You describe a software project or development goal, and Forge coordinates AI coding workers to plan, implement, validate, review, and progressively complete that work — never treating a worker's "done" as proof that the work is correct.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the intended design and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for engineering rules.

## Status

Early development. **Milestone 1 — Foundation Runtime** is implemented:

- typed, validated configuration from environment variables
- lightweight leveled logging (human-readable, stderr, secret-key redaction)
- a controlled process runner (no shell, explicit validated working directory, captured output, timeouts, cancellation, structured results)
- a small typed error model
- a minimal CLI (`--help`, `--version`, `doctor`)

Planning, workers, validation, review, Git integration, and autonomous execution are **not** implemented yet.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22.18.0** (Node 24 LTS recommended). Development and tests run TypeScript directly via Node's built-in type stripping, which is enabled by default from 22.18.
- npm (bundled with Node)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Optionally make the `forge` command available globally from this checkout:

```sh
npm link
```

## Configuration

Forge reads configuration from environment variables. `npm run dev` and `npm start` also load a local `.env` file if present — copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to get started. Never commit `.env`.

| Variable                   | Values                               | Default      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `FORGE_LOG_LEVEL`          | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`     | `info`       |
| `FORGE_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` | integer, 1 – 86400000                | `120000`     |
| `FORGE_ENV`                | `development`, `production`, `test`  | `production` |

Invalid values are reported together with a clear error; run `forge doctor` to check them.

## Development commands

| Command             | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev -- …`  | Run the CLI from source, e.g. `npm run dev -- doctor`    |
| `npm run build`     | Clean and compile to `dist/`                             |
| `npm start -- …`    | Run the compiled CLI, e.g. `npm start -- --help`         |
| `npm run typecheck` | Strict type check of sources and tests                   |
| `npm test`          | Run the test suite (`node:test`)                         |
| `npm run check`     | Typecheck, test, and build                               |

No linter is configured yet; strict TypeScript settings cover most correctness checks for now.

## CLI

```text
forge --help       Show help
forge --version    Show version
forge doctor       Check the local runtime: Node version, configuration, process runner
```

`forge doctor` exits with code `0` when all checks pass and `1` otherwise. Usage errors exit with `2`.
