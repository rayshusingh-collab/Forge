# Forge

Forge is a local-first AI software-development orchestrator. You describe a software project or development goal, and Forge coordinates AI coding workers to plan, implement, validate, review, and progressively complete that work — never treating a worker's "done" as proof that the work is correct.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the intended design and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for engineering rules.

## Status

Early development. Implemented so far:

**Milestone 1 — Foundation Runtime**

- typed, validated configuration from environment variables
- lightweight leveled logging (human-readable, stderr, secret-key redaction)
- a controlled process runner (no shell, explicit validated working directory, captured output, timeouts, cancellation, structured results)
- a small typed error model
- a minimal CLI (`--help`, `--version`, `doctor`)

**Milestone 2 — Project & Persistent State**

- registering a local Git repository as a Forge project with a stable ID
- versioned, validated, atomically written project metadata and state under `.forge/`
- lost-update protection for concurrent writers
- a project path boundary (traversal, prefix, case, and symlink/junction checks)
- project discovery from anywhere inside a project
- `forge project add | show | status`

Planning, workers, validation, review, and autonomous execution are **not** implemented yet. Forge does not run Claude Code or modify project code.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 22.18.0** (Node 24 LTS recommended). Development and tests run TypeScript directly via Node's built-in type stripping, which is enabled by default from 22.18.
- npm (bundled with Node)
- **Git** on `PATH` (required to register projects; the test suite creates temporary repositories)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Optionally make the `forge` command available globally from this checkout:

```sh
npm link
```

## Configuration

Forge reads configuration from environment variables. `npm run dev` and `npm start` also load a local `.env` file if present — copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to get started. Never commit `.env`.

| Variable                   | Values                               | Default      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `FORGE_LOG_LEVEL`          | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`     | `info`       |
| `FORGE_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` | integer, 1 – 86400000                | `120000`     |
| `FORGE_ENV`                | `development`, `production`, `test`  | `production` |

Invalid values are reported together with a clear error; run `forge doctor` to check them.

## Development commands

| Command             | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev -- …`  | Run the CLI from source, e.g. `npm run dev -- doctor`    |
| `npm run build`     | Clean and compile to `dist/`                             |
| `npm start -- …`    | Run the compiled CLI, e.g. `npm start -- --help`         |
| `npm run typecheck` | Strict type check of sources and tests                   |
| `npm test`          | Run the test suite (`node:test`)                         |
| `npm run check`     | Typecheck, test, and build                               |

No linter is configured yet; strict TypeScript settings cover most correctness checks for now.

## CLI

```text
forge --help                   Show help
forge --version                Show version
forge doctor                   Check the local runtime: Node, configuration, process runner, Git
forge project add <path>       Register a Git work tree root as a project
      [--name <name>]          Display name (default: directory name)
      [--description <text>]   Optional description
forge project show             Show the project containing the current directory
forge project status           Show that project's persisted state summary
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` failure, `2` usage error.

## Projects

Register the **root** of an existing Git work tree:

```sh
forge project add ../my-app --name "My App"
cd ../my-app/src
forge project status
```

`show` and `status` find the project by walking up from the current directory to the nearest `.forge/`.

Registration only creates `<project-root>/.forge/`. It does not initialize or configure Git, commit, push, install packages, run project scripts, or change any other file. It fails if the path does not exist, is not a directory, is not the root of a Git work tree, or is already registered (or contains a `.forge/` Forge doesn't recognize).

### What `.forge/` contains

| File           | Purpose                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project.json` | Project identity: stable ID, name, description, canonical root path, status, timestamps     |
| `state.json`   | Orchestration state: lifecycle phase, milestones, tasks, attempts, decisions, validation summaries, and a `revision` counter |
| `.gitignore`   | Contains `*`, so Git ignores all Forge metadata without touching the project's own `.gitignore` |
| `state.lock`   | Exists only briefly while state is being written                                             |

`.forge/` holds **Forge metadata only — never credentials**, and no logs or raw worker output. Both documents carry a `schemaVersion`. They are validated whenever they are read, because they may have been edited by hand. Forge refuses (rather than repairs) malformed, unsupported-version, or relocated metadata.

## Current limitations (Milestone 2)

- **Path safety:** the boundary resolves links for the parts of a path that exist. Components that don't exist yet can't be resolved, and a link created between the check and the use (time-of-check/time-of-use) isn't prevented. The boundary is a guard for Forge's own operations, not an OS sandbox.
- **Case sensitivity:** Windows paths compare case-insensitively. Elsewhere comparison is case-sensitive, so on case-insensitive macOS volumes a differently-cased path is conservatively treated as outside.
- **Moving a project:** moving a registered project directory invalidates its metadata, which records the original root. Re-registering requires removing `.forge/` manually.
- **Stale locks:** a stale `.forge/state.lock` left by a crashed process is not removed automatically. Delete it manually when no Forge process is running.
- **No project list:** there is no global registry of projects; each project is found through its own `.forge/`.
- **Inherited Git variables:** `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` set in Forge's own environment are passed through to Git and would affect repository detection.
